==============

1) Transaction creation
2) Transaction signature - using RSA digital signatures
2) Transaction validation
3) Transaction broadcast - through subnet broadcast service
3) Block mining - nonce generation
4) Block validation
5) Block broadcast 
8) Shared knowledge of the Block chain at every node

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN
===================

1) python -i app.py

Now you can use three functions as you like, mine_for_reward(), balances(), pay()
Please run the code in the same subnet on two different hosts.
